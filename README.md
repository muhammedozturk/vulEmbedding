This repository is devised to explain vulEmbedding,

1. First "altKlas√∂rTaraTahmin.R" file is for searching code files to generate suitable numeric matrix,
2. createKeywordMatrix.R is for generating keyword matrix, thereby checking vulnerabilities,
3. sphericalLabeling.R is for generating spherical labeling.
4. Final you can run deepnetVersion2.R to produce vulnerability prediction.

   If you are not concered with generating data from source code,

   just use keyword.txt and another data set.txt, run deepnetVersion2.R, thereby changing the paths that were set in your computer.
   Do not hesitate to ask me: muhammedozturk@sdu.edu.tr
